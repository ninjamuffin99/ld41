	spotlights that move around and obscure the view
	tooltips in phone for instructions
	when you shoot them too much you get penalized, maybe they go around telling rumors
	when bystanders talk shit they do so for a set amount of people
	obstacles like tables and chairs are barely moveable
	
Current Task:

	get AI enemy going
	lose state could be if you hit too  many chaperones
