Todo:
	you cant hit chaperones
	when you hit kids with kisses it shows kids with different colors
	charge up kiss could be different for different classes
	
	possibly, if you hit them too much, thye won't vote for you, and you might have to wait 20 seconds or something
	ending:Screen gets dark, camera goes to stage, then winners are announced
	maybe you have to hit them with a specific bullet to check what percentage they're at?
	
	spotlights that move around and obscure the view
	get heads to be the hearts icons
	tooltips in phone for instructions
	when you shoot them too much you get penalized, maybe they go around telling rumors
	lose state could be if you hit too  many chaperones
	chaperones chase you if you flirt with them too much, lose them if you're out of distance for a certain amount of time
	when bystanders talk shit they do so for a set amount of people
	obstacles like tables and chairs are barely moveable
	
Current Task:
	get AI enemy going
	
Done:
	shoot bullet to make them vote, and if you shoot them twice it negates it
	player has to check phone for time and votes
	a heart fades in on bystander when you get closer, and changes color depending on how much they like you
